# Reflection of Light Simulator
Generates a simulation of how an object reflects light to create virtual images

    Type a number in the "Angle of Incidence" box to determine the angle at 
        which (a) given ray(s) is reflected on the mirror
    Click any number of boxes on the grid outside the mirror (the area to the right of the horizontal line)
        to create your object
    Press "Generate" to produce your virtual image of the object
    
    Incident rays are denoted by                     ---> Green
    Reflected rays are denoted by                    ---> Orange
    The extention of the reflected ray is denoted by ---> Grey
    Object                                           ---> Green
    Virtual image                                    ---> Red
